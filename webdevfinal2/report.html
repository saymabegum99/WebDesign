			<h1> Report - Sayma Begum</h1>
			
			<p> URL- http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~sbegu035/webdevfinal2/index.html</p>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>My idea for the Bangladeshiful website began while I was reading a book about the history of the Bengal. I was facinated by the depth of knowledge I had gained simply by reading but was also saddened by the fact that the bengali community itself knows very little about their own history. Especially the newer bengali generation in the UK. This is why I chose to make tihs website to educate the Bangladeshi community about Bangladeshi history and also chose to educate people about modern day Bangladesh by providing news articles. 
			The structure was inspired by newspapers as they have columns to the side and a main article which is shown in the centre and the right of the page. The structure is very simple and easy to work with.
		</p>
			
			<h2> 
			   Inspiration
			</h2>
			
			<p> Three things mainly inspired me to make a website based on Bangladeshi news and history. The first inspiration began with reading a book on Bangladesh as mentioned previously. The book is called A Bangladesh history by William Van Schendel who explains the history behind Bangladesh dating as far back as the Mughal empire. It gives a great overview about the country and its vast history but also is not afraid to dive deeper make connections with geography and politics. It gave me the impression that Bangladesh is not just about the war of independance which many others believe it to be, but it is a country which lies within the largest delta in the world and thus has a large amount of history of different civilisations and tribes. I wanted others to learn about this as so many are unaware of their own ancestoral history.
			<br> 
			<br> 
			Another inspiration for me was a documentary that I had seen. The documentary called The Bangladesh story which was made by the BBC, it gave me an in depth view of the stages which led up to the war and the after effects it had which have been still a problem with Bangladesh as of now. The latest article I had written on the website in fact explains this with the new general elections. I felt that it is very important history and context for people to understand the problems of the modern day and therefore I merged these two things together. 
			<br> 
			<br> 
			The final inspiration was my parents. They were only children during the war but  They have taught me my mother tongue, took me to bengali classes after school and made sure that we visited our family in Bangladesh regularly growing up. This naturally drew me an interest in my own culture and therefore I thought it was only fitting for me to make a website because of this passion for history culture. 
			</p>
			
			<h2>Accessibility</h2>
			I tried to make the site accessible to all users and I have done this in three ways. I used the alt feature in image tags so that users who have a slow internet connection and the image fails to load for them can have a hint of what the image was to be. For example a picture of a field would be called ' A young girl running in a field with a Bangladeshi flag' Which I have written in one of my pages. The alt tag is also helpful for people who have a visual impairment, if they were to use text to speech the voice would read out the alt tag instead, so for this reason I tried to be descriptive as possible. 
			I also tried to make the website accessbile by using the colours appropiately, I knew about colour theory and what colours go well together specifically for websites and text. This is useful to the visually impaired as they might find it hard to read text which had are similar in colour, or have issues with brightness. It is also helpful for those who are colour blind and have a difficulty to make out some colours. The social media tags I found had been small and could be hard to see for the visually impaired or the elderly, therefore I allowed the icons to enlarge by almost double the size so it wouldn't be an issue to read.
			
			<h2>  Usability  </h2>
			<p> The website is very usable for users because I've added features like a navigation bar. This allows users to know and view the different pages they want. It also is helpful because it seperates the topics in the website and people know to go to which page to find the information they are looking for.
			<br>
			<br> 
			Another feature is the collapsible button, it allows users to navigate through the news page without being bombarded with a lot of text. Therefore the content in the boxes are kept nice and neat and so the user could have a easier time to click on the article title which they want to read without having to scroll down so much.
				
			<br>
			<br> 
			Another feature which makes this site very usable is the simplicity of the site. It is not very complicated and each section of the website is clearly distinct. I have colour coded each of the sections mainly green and grey so the users know that the left hand column and the section which is used to introduce the user to the page is mainly white and the bulk of the information is written with a background of pale green. This makes it easier for the user to navigate around the site. 
			
			
			
			</p>
			<h2> Things I learnt </h2>
			
			<p>There are many things I learnt while creating my site. For example I learnt how to use the mapping tool. This is an excellent feature when you want to have interactive features in your website. I had checked an example in W3schools but the website did not mention how to go about knowing the positions for the image which you need while using the map feature. Therefore I had to use alternative methods, this is where I learnt that microsoft paint had a way of overcoming this problem and therefore I had used paint to work out the positions of the images. 
			
			<br>
			<br>
			I also learnt how to code the current date, this I learnt from a tutorial. I found it very helpful and suprising that Javascript had a feature date function which allows you to get the current date. I tried to find how to do this however I had trouble researching this using tradtional methods, looking at stackoverflow. I found them quite confusing and not very helpful as they tended to embed javascript in the html whereas I wanted the Javascript file to be external files. I then used a youtube video which was more like a tutorial and it was very easy to learn. 
				
			<br>
			<br>
			Learning how to make collapsible boxes using W3schools was very helpful. I've seen features like these in other websites and wanted to add it to my own. It allowed me to organise my website with articles as articles tend to be long and take up much of the space. Though I changed some of the code to allow the background to be transparent. 
			</p>
			
			<h2> Things which worked well</h2>
			<p>The collapsible boxes which I put the articles I think were the best feature in the site. This is because the usefulness for the user and for me whilst using the site. As the site progresses with more articles, the articles can be clearly identified without the need to scroll down.I like how interactive this feature is too as users can select the articles they personally want.  </p>
			
			<p> Another aspect of the website which worked well is the fact that everything looks very uniform and similar. I like the layout of the website, it has a familiarity about it, like looking into a regular newspaper. The colour of the website and the structure gives it an overall appealing and calming look, I also had fun picking the gradient, colour scheme and logo for the website. </p>
			
			<h2> Improvements</h2>
			<p> There are a lot of things which can be improved, for example the website currently does not allow users to submit their comments in the contact us box. This is because I don't have a database for it and havn't researched into PHP but perhaps I will in the future. Creating a real working contact box would be very useful as users can comment and provide their input aswell as myself.</p>
			
		
			<p> Another element which could improve the website is have a fact file show up when clicking each city on the map. I only added pictures of the cities instead, but users could easily go online and do that. I think  it would be a unique feature if I had created my own image where an image of the city and basic facts about that city. There would be also a real reason of why I added the map feature into the site too.

			<h3> Content boxes for articles</h3>
			<p>(1)I changed the collapsible box by adding the article title, so users can see what article they want to read. In CSS I also changed the colour, making the box green to suite the website theme and changed the font to the font on google. In JavaScript I changed the style of the collapsible box by changing the boxes into inline boxes instead of block boxes, this is so that the background can be displayed at the back, the block style seems too bright and can be a strain on the eyes, the style also seems too chunky and therefore inline boxes have a better appearance.

			<h3>@media and some appearance/ responsiveness for website </h3>
			<p>(2)I used these links to help me make my website work in different devices, I however did change the code, for example the colour schemes and some of the layout (in the news and the about us page where there aren’t columns. I also added other @media tags which have been used for images and the content boxes all of which I had to change the widths for.

			<h3>Filter Tables</h3>
			<p>(4)	I used filter tables so that users can look up certain facts about different cities in Bangladesh. I altered the code by changing the X and Y column in the table to titles which related to Bangladesh.  I also changed the JavaScript, the grey text which sits in the search bar, this is so it could be related to cities instead of specific names and set the style of the table after filtering to ‘table-row.’ In the CSS, the search bar also has a much thicker grooved border, and the background of the table has been changed to a white colour instead of being transparent.

             <h3> Colour Gradient</h3>
			<p> (5)	I used a generator to use this and simply copy and pasted the gradient code onto the top of the webpage to create a background.

			<h3> Social Media Tags</h3>
			<p>(6)	I used social media tags in my website so that users can easily share the site whilst their browsing. Within the HTML I added the links to the social media for each tag and changed all the tags to black in CSS so that the colours can stand out to those who have visual impairment and made the tag enlarge when the user hovers over it.

			<h3> Tiger Logo</h3>
			<p> (7)	The website provides different images and logos which can be altered by colour and can be downloaded into a SVG format, I used an image of a tiger as my logo which I then added to my web pages.

			<h3>Contact form</h3>
			<p>
			(8)	I’ve changed the contact form by making slight alterations for example adding more options so that people can select their country, if they are from outside the UK etc, adding grooves in the CSS to make the form look more like buttons and adjusted the font to suite the website theme.  The contact form is important so that users could provide their feedback.

			<h3>Linking external JavaScript sheets</h3>
			<p>(9)	At the beginning I had struggled to link my JavaScript file to the html however I managed to solve the problem after following this video.

			<h3>Fonts</h3>
			<p>(10)	I used an external font via google fonts, I simply linked the website on the html and used it for h1, h2, h3 etc in CSS, I thought they seemed more appealing to the eye.

           <h3> Displaying the Date</h3>
			<p>(11)	I have altered this code by deleting the JavaScript code which dealt with time as I did not add it to the site, this also meant that I had to rename the variable names to names which suited my website, for example ‘my clock’ became ‘mydate’,  I have also merged the code with the body tag, initially I had coded two body tags to align it under the ‘Bangladeshiful’ heading however it was causing problems with the html validator so I had to compromise by merging it with the body tag at the very top to compensate.  The date is important so that users can easily compare the present date to the dates in the articles.

			</p>
			
			<h3>SlideShow</h3>
			<p>(12)	I used a slideshow so that I could show images of Bangladesh and introduce users to the site. I ended up deleting the dot feature because I didn’t think it was necessary. I also added a text shadow feature on the text so that it is visible when it is displayed at the front of the image. Whilst coding the JavaScript I had some trouble with getting the slideshow to display image 1, I soon realised that the variable to display the slide equalled to slide 1. However, my slide show is not displayed automatically and therefore when a user clicks on an arrow it takes the user to slide 2 instead, to solve this I changed the variable to 0 instead.

			<h3> Responsive top navigation </h3>
			<p>(13)	Changed the top navigation font to the google font and the gradient using the gradient generator mentioned above, changed the @ media tag max width to 767 for navigation bars as I found out that it is the size of most small tablets.
