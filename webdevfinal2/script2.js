document.write("47 years ago Bangladesh claimed its victory over West Pakistani rule. But how did the events specifically fold out? Well our story does not start with Bangladesh, nor East Pakistan and not West Pakistan, the war of liberation starts with the British empire. First and foremost one must understand the history and politics which occured during the mess of which became known as the partition period. It was decided by the leaders of the time (Mummmad Ali Jinnah and Jawaharlal Nehru) that India would be split into two, divided largely on religous terms. India became the land belonging to the Hindu and Pakistan (both east and west) belonged to the Muslims. <br/> <br/> However, this caused one of the largest mass exodus in the modern era, many families were forced to make the dangerous and trecherous journey of moving to these new lands, many of them had even chose to leave their homelands on foot and it wasn't long until violence and bloodshed broke out. Bangladesh was named 'East Pakitan' in this time and was under the authority of West Pakistan, a land which was seperated more than 1500 kilometres away by India had become rather tyranical. Both countries had shared a common religon but they couldn't be more different in other aspects as they were in fact divdied by language, distance, culture and economics. <br/> <br/> West Pakistan was larger than the east and had the nations capital but East Pakistan had actually accounted for over 60% of the population. West Pakistan had monopolised the armed, civil and diplomatic forces while East Pakistan had contritubted to 75% of all exports and foreign earnings yet only ever recieved around 30% of imports and investments. West Pakistan began treating East Pakistan as its colony which had by in large become a satalite state. <br/> <br/> In 1970 during first free elections, Shiekh Mujibur Rahman (from East Pakistan) won a majority vote in Pakistans national parliment. However the general Yahya Khan from West Pakistan despised this. They prefered the West Pakistani leader Zulfikar Bhutto, he then refused Mujib becoming the leader of the nation, which later resulted Mujib calling for a general strike the very next day in which he gave his famous speech, the speech of Bangabandhu. Riots were strife and the Bengali army mutinied and on March 25th West Pakistan had begun their crackdown and war had now become inevitable. <br/> <br/> The war had some of the biggest atrosities, 3 million people died in a matter of motnhs and around 200,000-400,000 women were raped under 'Operation Searchlight' where the West Pakistani army had made a desperate attempt of eradicating the bengali ethnicity. West Pakistan had even deliberately targeted universities and schools (known as the killing of the intellecuals') Even they understood that knowledge is a powerful tool, learn to use it and it could become potentially dangerous. <br/> <br/>As a second generation Bengalis we have a duty to view the war not as something of the past but rather as lesson. The problems and battles they had faced during the war all exist today in our own modern timeline, whether it would be overcoming dictators or fighting for the land which you had grown up in.  Many people in our community have somehow learnt habbit of embarassment with our culture. This war was very recent, happening in 1971 and our own parents, our grandfathers may have fought or had witnessed the tradegy which unfolded then, it is therefore our duty to talk, to unseal this taboo and start a conversation. So as a final thought, let us instead be proud of our people, the poeple who have fought for our language, our culture, our existence and our freedom.");
